    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage of the project focused on transforming around 10 GB of raw job posting data from the Coresignal Multi-Source Jobs Dataset into a structured, analysis-ready format. To ensure the data remained manageable on local hardware while maintaining depth, the following steps were completed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Targeted Extraction: I have narrowed the scope to over 2 062 382 observations from 2025 specifically within the United States, filtering for key technical roles such as developers, analysts, and engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Integrity: The dataset was refined by removing 720 741 duplicate entries and filtering out job titles that lacked any programming language mentions (e.g., academic researchers or pure management roles).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Technical Standardization: Using the extract_programming_languages function, we identified mentions of 22 programming languages. Ambiguous terms like \"Go\" were processed using a local Large Language Model (Ollama) with a temperature of 0 to ensure high reproducibility and minimize false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Categorization: To understand market trends, I have engineered five high-level job categories: Manager, Engineer, Analyst, Scientist, and Developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting processed dataset contains 602 359 high-quality job postings, significantly reduced from the initial data, allowing for efficient and high-impact EDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Suggestions for Further Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "The error rate calculations for the LLM used for the interpretation programming languages could be done. I think this will be marginal improvement and will not change the results that much, but just for the sake of being precice and redusing the error this should be done. "
