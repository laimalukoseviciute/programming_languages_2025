# PROJECT TITLE: Subtile 

## 1. Executive Summary: Why This Matters
*This section is the primary destination for C-Level executives and the PR team. It should summarize the **key finding** or **business value** derived from the analysis, written in clear, non-technical language.*

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the performance and utilization of our ethical proxy network within critical market verticals. The primary objective is to strategically inform resource allocation and identify emerging trends in public web data demand.

**Key Insight:** analysis has identified . This finding enables... the PR team to ....

The final report, available in the `outputs/reports` directory, provides detailed findings and technical context.

## 2. Project Overview

This repository standardizes the workflow for ad-hoc data analysis projects, ensuring efficiency, reproducibility, and high-quality reporting via [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

**Focus Areas:**
* Operational performance monitoring (latency, success rate, throughput).
* Correlation of network activity with global market trends.
* Automated reporting for PR and C-level communication.

## 3. Repository Structure

The project follows a standardized Data Science file structure, facilitating quick navigation and collaboration.

| Directory | Purpose | Key Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`data/`** | Storage for raw and processed datasets. **Raw data is excluded from Git.** | `data/raw/`, `data.csv` |
| **`src/`** | Core reusable Python code. Essential for automation and reproducibility. | `data_cleaning.py`, `analysis.py`, `reporting.py` |
| **`outputs/`** | Final products generated by the analysis pipeline. | `figures/`, `tables/`, `reports/` (PDF, HTML) |
| **`notebooks/`**| Exploratory analysis and drafting. **Scripts in `src/` should be finalized logic.** | `01_EDA_initial.ipynb`, `02_Drafting_Visualizations.ipynb` |
| **`config/`** | Configuration files for paths and parameters. | `settings.ini` |
| **`reports/`** | Quarto source files used for generating the final documents. | `final_report.qmd` |

## 4. Setup and Installation (For Technical Users)

To replicate this environment and run the analysis, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
* [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) or [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is recommended for environment management.
* [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) must be installed on your local machine to render the reports.

### Environment Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourOrg/repo-name.git](https://github.com/YourOrg/repo-name.git)
    cd repo-name
    ```
2.  **Create and activate the environment** using the provided specification:
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate project-name
    ```
3.  **Data Acquisition:** Ensure the necessary raw data file (`operational_proxy_data.csv`) is placed in the `data/raw/` directory. (Note: Raw data files are typically excluded from Git using `.gitignore`).

## 5. Usage and Execution

The entire analysis pipeline, from data cleaning to report generation, can be executed via a single entry point script.

1.  **Run the Analysis Script:**
    ```bash
    python run_analysis.py
    ```
    *This script orchestrates the calls to modules within `src/` and generates all assets in the `outputs/` directory.*

2.  **Generate the Final Report (Quarto):**
    ```bash
    quarto render notebooks/Project\ Template.ipynb --to pdf --output-dir ./outputs/reports --output Project-Report.pdf --pdf-engine xelatex
    ```
    *This command will process the Quarto Markdown file, run the embedded Python code, and generate the final PDF (and/or HTML) report in `outputs/reports`.*

## 6. Outputs and Reporting

Final reports, ready for distribution, are automatically placed here:
* **PDF Report:** `outputs/reports/final_report.pdf`
* **Interactive HTML Report (if applicable):** `outputs/reports/interactive_report.html`

All generated figures are stored in `outputs/figures/`.
